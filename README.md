# Hospital Readmission Analysis
## Overview:
This project analyzes U.S. hospital readmission rates to identify trends and key drivers impacting healthcare costs and patient outcomes. Using publicly available datasets, I explored how different conditions, hospital performance, and geography contribute to readmissions.
### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* Data cleaning and transformation in Power Query
* Advanced Excel analysis and presentation - pivot tables, KPIs, charts
* Business insights and storytelling for healthcare management
## Dataset
* Source: (Medicare Hospital Readmission Reduction Program) - https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3
* Size: ~5,000 hospitals
* Variables: Hospital ID, condition-specific readmission rates, state, penalties, etc.
## Questions Explored
1. Which conditions have the highest readmission rates nationally?
2. Are there geographic patterns in readmission rates?
3. How do hospital penalties correlate with readmission performance?
4. What insights can support reducing costs and improving patient outcomes?
